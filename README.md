# Game Camp
Game Camp is an open-source project aimed at helping anyone learn to make mobile games using Python, by developing teaching materials and tutorials that make the process fun and accessible. It is based on Python and Kivy, and targets Android and IOS devices. We are looking for developers, educators, designers from a wide variety of backgrounds and skill levels to help us develop the Game Camp materials.
